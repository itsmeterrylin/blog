## Background

My career started at UBS Investment Bank in Taiwan, but finance was not my path. After traveling Southeast Asia and meeting a product designer named Jon Myers, I discovered product marketing, project management, and ultimately product management. It's where I've been since 2017.

## What I'm Working On

In July 2019, I joined a company named CB Insights based in New York City. My day-to-day revolves around tools and backend-heavy features like ElasticSearch. This work involves the intricate details of data relevanceâ€”tuning search algorithms, weighting results, and balancing the eternal product challenge of recall versus precision.

Outside of work, I've been leveling up technical skills with a side project called [Copper's Corner](https://www.copperscorner.com/), a fitness tracker using Voice AI.
